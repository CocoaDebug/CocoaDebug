/*! A simple class for demultiplexing NSURLSession delegate callbacks to a per-task delegate object.

    You initialise the class with a session configuration. After that you can create data tasks 
    within that session by calling -dataTaskWithRequest:delegate:modes:.  Any delegate callbacks 
    for that data task are redirected to the delegate on the thread that created the task in 
    one of the specified run loop modes.  That thread must run its run loop in order to get 
    these callbacks.
*/

@interface _QNSURLSessionDemux : NSObject

/*! Create a demultiplex for the specified session configuration.
 *  \param configuration The session configuration to use; if nil, a default session is created.
 *  \returns An initialised instance.

/*! Creates a new data task whose delegate callbacks are routed to the supplied delegate.
 *  \details The callbacks are run on the current thread (that is, the thread that called this 
 *  method) in the specified modes.
 *
 *  The delegate is retained until the task completes, that is, until after your 
 *  -URLSession:task:didCompleteWithError: delegate callback returns.
 *
 *  The returned task is suspend.  You must resume the returned task for the task to 
 *  make progress.  Furthermore, it's not safe to simply discard the returned task 
 *  because in that case the task's delegate is never released.
 *
 *  \param request The request that the data task executes; must not be nil.
 *  \param delegate The delegate to receive the data task's delegate callbacks; must not be nil.
 *  \param modes The run loop modes in which to run the data task's delegate callbacks; if nil or 
 *  empty, the default run loop mode (NSDefaultRunLoopMode is used).
 *  \returns A suspended data task that you must resume.
