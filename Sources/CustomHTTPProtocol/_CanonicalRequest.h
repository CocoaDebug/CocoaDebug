/*! Returns a canonical form of the supplied request.
 *  \details The Foundation URL loading system needs to be able to canonicalize URL 
 *  requests for various reasons (for example, to look for cache hits).  The default 
 *  HTTP/HTTPS protocol has a complex chunk of code to perform this function.  Unfortunately 
 *  there's no way for third party code to access this.  Instead, we have to reimplement 
 *  it all ourselves.  This is split off into a separate file to emphasise that this 
 *  is standard boilerplate that you probably don't need to look at.
 *  
 *  IMPORTANT: While you can take most of this code as read, you might want to tweak 
 *  the handling of the "Accept-Language" in the CanonicaliseHeaders routine.
 *  \param request The request to canonicalise; must not be nil.
 *  \returns The canonical request; should never be nil.
