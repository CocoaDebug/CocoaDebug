 *  To use this class you should set up your delegate (+setDelegate:) and then call +start. 
 *  If you don't call +start the class is completely benign.
 *
 *  The really tricky stuff here is related to the authentication challenge delegate 
 *  callbacks; see the docs for _CustomHTTPProtocolDelegate for the details.

/*! The delegate for the CustomHTTPProtocol class (not its instances).
 *  \details The delegate handles two different types of callbacks:
 *
 *  - authentication challenges
 * 
 *  - logging
 *
 *  The latter is very simple.  The former is quite tricky.  The basic idea is that each CustomHTTPProtocol 
 *  instance sends the delegate a serialised stream of authentication challenges, each of which it is 
 *  expected to resolve.  The sequence is as follows:
 *
 *  -# It calls -customHTTPProtocol:canAuthenticateAgainstProtectionSpace: to determine if the delegate 
 *     can handle the challenge.  This can be call on an arbitrary background thread.
 *
 *  -# If the delegate returns YES, it calls -customHTTPProtocol:didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge: to 
 *     actually process the challenge.  This is always called on the main thread.  The delegate can resolve 
 *     the challenge synchronously (that is, before returning from the call) or it can return from the call 
 *     and then, later on, resolve the challenge.  Resolving the challenge involves calling 
 *     -[CustomHTTPProtocol resolveAuthenticationChallenge:withCredential:], which also must be called 
 *     on the main thread.  Between the calls to -customHTTPProtocol:didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge: 
 *     and -[CustomHTTPProtocol resolveAuthenticationChallenge:withCredential:], the protocol's 
 *     pendingChallenge property will contain the challenge.
 *
 *  -# While there is a pending challenge, the protocol may call -customHTTPProtocol:didCancelAuthenticationChallenge: 
 *     to cancel the challenge.  This is always called on the main thread.
 *
 *  Note that this design follows the original NSURLConnection model, not the newer NSURLConnection model 
 *  (introduced in OS X 10.7 / iOS 5) or the NSURLSession model, because of my concerns about performance.  
 *  Specifically, -customHTTPProtocol:canAuthenticateAgainstProtectionSpace: can be called on any thread 
 *  but -customHTTPProtocol:didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge: is called on the main thread.  If I unified 
 *  them I'd end up calling the resulting single routine on the main thread, which meanings a lot more 
 *  bouncing between threads, much of which would be pointless in the common case where you don't want to 
 *  customise the default behaviour.  Alternatively I could call the unified routine on an arbitrary thread, 
 *  but that would make it harder for clients and require a major rework of my implementation.
